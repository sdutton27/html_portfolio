                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <strong><small>A brief description of myself:</small></strong>
                <p>My name is Simon Dutton and I was born in Orlando, FL. The summer after my freshman
                    year of high school, I moved up to Massachusetts, for financial reasons and to be 
                    closer to family. I had come from one of the largest school districts in the country
                    and then moved to an incredibly small public school, which was a huge change. I went to college 
                    also in Massachusetts, getting my degree in Computer Science and Music. More on that in my "My Background" 
                    section. I was set to graduate in 2020, when, as everyone knows, the world changed. On top of the global
                    pandemic, I have experienced a lot of medical issues in the past couple years, not only with myself but with the rest of my immediate family. After 
                    my father passed away, I moved up to Portland, Maine with my college roommates and spent two years
                    working (probably too many hours): taking the early morning Starbucks shift, and then working at a local school as an assistant teacher, and through their after-care program. 
                    During this time, I also spent my summers working as a lifeguard/boat driver for a summer camp that has become
                    very close to my heart. This past fall, I moved down to the Boston, MA area since my formerly-long-distance
                    girlfriend got a job working as a nurse at a children's hospital here. My family and I have always dealt
                    with financial issues, which is one of the reasons that has given me the drive to be the incredibly hard worker that I am. I also have a huge heart
                    and care immensely not only just about the people who are most important to me, but about anyone I get a chance to connect with.
                    I am currently working full-time as an activities coordinator for a memory care facility, but am incredibly
                    excited to open my options to new opportunities in my ideal work field of choice.

                <h1>My Background</h1>
                <strong><small>My history with coding:</small></strong>
                <p>
                    As mentioned in my "About Me" section, I got my degree in Computer Science (and Music) in 2020. Coming from a very small,
                    rural public school, I did not have access to coding until I got to college. I had enrolled in CS-101 my first semester of college,
                    as I had always been good with technology and curious about coding, and ended up falling in love with the logic puzzles and the way
                    that I could also visually organize/design my code/software. I immediately signed up to help with the "MaGE Program," a Google-funded program
                    at my school where upper-level CS students would lead "Active Learning Modules" and help with the labs for the intro-CS courses,
                    as well as go over assigned students' code with them in weekly 1-on-1 meetings. I loved getting to share my passion for coding, and
                    also offer support to students who were struggling with the concepts. The program really focused on building self-efficacy and 
                    I loved getting to contribute to building up the confidence of others going through the same courses I had just recently taken.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I studied abroad my junior year in Ireland and got to take a couple of classes in Performance Technology and Creative Coding.
                    These were some of my favorite classes that I got to take because they were more hands-on than a lot of the theory-based courses required
                    for my degree. As a double-major, I did not have a lot of time in my schedule to take all the CS electives I would've wanted to take, and therefore what I do remember from my degree is sadly not very applicable to actually getting a job.
                    I am excited about how hands-on this course already is, and how much I know I will learn and grow. With all the hardships I have faced in my
                    personal life the past couple years, I have had to spend time away from the field of CS, needing to have a full-time job without being able to 
                    afford time to spend on furthering my education/applying for jobs. At this point, I was beginning to give up hope of ever having a career in this 
                    field which I not only love, but also feel uses my brain at its favorite capacity. I feel incredibly grateful to have found Coding Temple
                    and given myself the opportunity to get back into developing, and to finally get a career in this incredibly competitive industry. I can't wait to learn
                    so many new languages/programs, and refresh myself on that which I used to be familiar.

                <h1>Why Developing?</h1>
                <strong><small>(and why Coding Temple?)</small></strong>
                <p> From my very first experience with coding, I have thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of it. 
                    I love how logically there are solutions to every* bug / problem you face, and the rush of satisfaction
                    when you finally get past something that was making you struggle. I love the way it uses my brain and getting
                    to come up with out-of-the-box solutions. I have chosen Coding Temple because not only does it fit with my schedule,
                    but everything seemed to come into place for me to move towards my goal in this way. I am excited for the forward movement in my field of choice, and also to learn
                    so many new programs/languages.
