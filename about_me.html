                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <strong><small>A brief description of myself:</small></strong>
                    <p>My name is Simon Dutton and I was born in Orlando, FL. The summer after my freshman
                    year of high school, I moved up to Massachusetts, for financial reasons and to be 
                    closer to family. I had come from one of the largest school districts in the country
                    and then moved to an incredibly small public school, which was a huge change. I went to college 
                    also in Massachusetts, getting my degree in Computer Science and Music. More on that in my "My Background" 
                    section. I was set to graduate in 2020, when, as everyone knows, the world changed. On top of the global
                    pandemic, I experienced a lot of medical issues, not only with myself but with the rest of my immediate family. After 
                    my father passed away, I moved up to Portland, Maine with my college roommates and spent two years
                    working (probably too many hours), taking the morning Starbucks shift, and then working at a local school as an assistant teacher, and through their after-care program. 
                    During this time, I also spent my summers working as a lifeguard/boat driver for a summer camp that has become
                    very close to my heart. This past fall, I moved down to the Boston, MA area since my formerly-long-distance
                    girlfriend got a job working as a nurse at a children's hospital here. My family and I have always dealt
                    with financial issues, and that has given me the drive to be the incredibly hard worker that I am. I also have a huge heart
                    and care immensely not only just about the people who are most important to me, but about anyone I get a chance to connect with.
                    I am currently working full-time as an activities coordinator for a memory care facility, but am incredibly
                    excited to open my options to new opportunities in my ideal work field of choice.
