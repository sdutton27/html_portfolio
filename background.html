                    <h1>My Background</h1>
                    <strong><small>My history with coding:</small></strong>
                    <p>
                        As mentioned in my "About Me" section, I got my degree in Computer Science (and Music) in 2020. Coming from a very small,
                        rural public school, I did not have access to coding until I got to college. I had enrolled in CS-101 my first semester of college,
                        as I had always been good with technology and curious about coding, and ended up falling in love with the logic puzzles and the way
                        that I could also visually organize/design my code/software. I immediately signed up to help with the "MaGE Program," a Google-funded program
                        at my school where upper-level CS students would lead "Active Learning Modules" and help with the labs for the intro-CS courses,
                        as well as go over assigned students' code with them in weekly 1-on-1 meetings. I loved getting to share my passion for coding, and
                        also offer support to students who were struggling with the concepts. The program really focused on building self-efficacy and 
                        I loved getting to contribute to building up the confidence of others going through the same courses I had just recently taken.

                        I studied abroad my junior year in Ireland and got to take a couple of classes in Performance Technology and Creative Coding.
                        These were some of my favorite classes that I got to take because they were more hands-on than a lot of the theory-based courses required
                        for my degree. As a double-major, I did not have a lot of time in my schedule to take all the CS electives I would've wanted to take.
                        I am excited about how hands-on this course already is, and how much I know I will learn and grow. With all the hardships I have faced in my
                        personal life the past couple years, I have had to spend time away from the field of CS, needing to have a full-time job without being able to 
                        afford time to spend on furthering my education/applying for jobs. At this point, I was beginning to give up hope of ever having a career in the 
                        field which not only I love, but also felt used my brain at its favorite capacity. I feel incredibly grateful to have found Coding Temple
                        and given myself the opportunity to get back into developing, and to finally get a career in this incredibly competitive industry. I can't wait to learn
                        so many new languages/programs, and refresh myself on that which I used to be familiar.
